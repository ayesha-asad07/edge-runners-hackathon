# DefendX: 
AI Cybersecurity Model for Edge DevicesWelcome to DefendX, an AI-powered cybersecurity solution designed to enhance the security of edge devices by detecting unusual login activities, background-running malware, and abnormal traffic at routers.
# Features
 - **Unusual Login Activity Detection:**
         Monitor and flag suspicious login attempts on edge devices.
 -  **Malware Detection:**
         Identify and block malware processes running in the background.
 - **Router-Level Traffic Monitoring:**
         Analyze and detect unusual traffic patterns to prevent unauthorized access.
# Project Structure
- **..data.py file:**
   Code for generating synthetic data used to train the model.
- **..model.py:**
   Code for creating and training AI models using Llama 3.1 and Phi-3.
- **..app.py:**
   Frontend implementation using Streamlit for user interaction.
# Technologies Used
- Llama 3.1:
     Advanced AI model used for synthetic data generation and pattern analysis.
- Phi-3 Models:
      Optimized for lightweight edge device deployment, enabling real-time threat detection.
